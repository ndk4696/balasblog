After my retirement, I started getting too many posts from friends and strangers through WhatsApp and other media. All these are about how to cope up with retirement, how to maintain relationships, how to keep  good health, what are the deceases likely to attack, their remedies, how it is likely that due to retirement people may get into depression etc etc. In fact after going through all these posts, I have gone into depression. These posts create so much negative feelings that I thought I have come to the end of my present life and waiting for reincarnation. Till few weeks ago I was the most active person doing a stressful job successfully and how suddenly I would become old and a burden to the family and society?  

Somehow, wisdom dawned on me and I myself have formulated success mantras for a peaceful and successful retired life. Go through if you feel like.

1.Do not read any posts pertaining to retired life. They  are likely to make you feel inferior and cause real frustration. You are better off without that knowledge. After all, you have to live your life and you are matured enough to handle it.

2. If you are not in agreement with me and wanted to go through such posts, remember to not to blidnly  follow those directions given in those posts. That way you can keep your individuality and self confidence.
3. If somebody suggest you to do regular excercise/brisk walk/weights etc etc, don't get carried away. You may be receiving this type of suggestions since your childhood. If you have such good habits it is ok. If not, realise that  at this age it is difficult to create  such new habits. So, do it at your own pace, if you still want to do.

4.  Don't calculate calories while eating. Instead, don't eat more than 80% of your capacity. That is enough to keep you active.

5. A lot is written on relationships in these posts. Ignore it. Trust me, your family will not ill treat/ ignore you  all of a sudden because you have retired. If you behave normal or better than you were before retirement, you get the best support from the family.
6. Be very rational with your money and don't give any place for emotions in money matters. Learn to enjoy your money keeping in mind your expected life span of max. 15-20 years or even less.  
7. Make others understand that you have worked sufficiently hard throughout your life and have earned this retirement. Nobody has the right to criticize you that you are without work. 
8. Don't spend much time with older people who keep boasting about their achievements. This is a waste of time. Instead, try to spend more time with youngsters listening to them. It will make you feel young and keep you in touch with the present reality. Word of caution: Don't preach and bore them with your past achievements. If you do so, soon they will avoid you.
9. Never lose your sense of humor and natural wit. It helps you keep going throughout your life.
